<h2>Defusal</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A challenging and rewarding puzzle game based on physics and collisions. You 	must become one with the bouncy ball launcher.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>

    
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle/2D Shooter
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player has control of a gun/launcher that shoots a limited number of bouncy 	balls in any direction. With a finite set of shots, tactful placement and problem solving 	skills will progress the player from level to level. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Smooth, friendly graphics and an awesome soundtrack. Different types of bouncy 	balls 	which have different levels of bounciness combined with the power to choose the 	starting velocity of each ball will allow the player to come up with creative and satisfying 	solutions to the problems at hand. Multiple different game modes like Time Attack, 	Endless Bouncy Balls and Classic will keep the player coming back for more.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is not story driven at all, so the setting is completely contained without any 	resemblance to reality. The world consists of various different surfaces on which to 	ricochet off of, and elements such as wind of glue to alter the bounce intensity on 	different sections. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Any casual gamers who have problem solving abilities required by Nancy 	Drew: Treasure in the Royal Tower or Angry Birds.
